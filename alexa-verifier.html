<p>Verify Alexa skills requests sent by Amazon&rsquo;s Echo devices.<p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>This node performs the security checks mandated by Amazon in the 
<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/host-a-custom-skill-as-a-web-service.html">Alexa 
Skills Kit</a> for Alexa skills hosted as external web services.  It confirms that 
the incoming request contains a valid request signature and a recent timestamp.</p>
<p>The skill's Application ID must be checked seperately. Some skills requests, 
AudioPlayer status updates for example, do not contain an Application ID.</p>
<p>This node is a wrapper for Mike Reinstein&rsquo;s 
<a href="https://github.com/mreinstein/alexa-verifier">alexa-verifier</a> NodeJS 
module.</p>
<h4>Outputs</h4>
<p>If the incoming request does not pass the verification checks, a msg with a msg.statusCode
set and a payload containing an error message describing the reason for the failure 
will be emitted through the &lsquo;invalid&rdquo; output port.</p>
<p>If the incoming request passes the checks, the request will be emitted unchanged
through the &ldquo;valid&rdquo; output port.</p>
